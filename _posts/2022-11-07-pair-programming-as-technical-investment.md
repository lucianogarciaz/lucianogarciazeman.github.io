Pair programming is an investment.

**From Wikipedia: Pair programming** is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

### Misunderstandings

"Less bugs": will NOT assure you of not having bugs

# So... Why?

Because allow us to deliver value faster with this benefits: 

- Improve code readability
- Help us to explore a solution when working in an spike or new product
- On remote companies, improve bonding between colleagues.
- Understand better the domain
- Lower risk of [Bus Factor](https://www.notion.so/Bus-factor-86d319dd1eac48009e3f51aef463265b)
- "Two heads are better than one"
- Removes the "only expert" in the team

## When?

- Working on a [Spike](https://lucianogarciaz.github.io/thoughts/2022/11/07/spike.html)
- A new team member joined the team
- Exploring for a solution
- Creating a new product
- At least one team member is senior
- It's going to be taken important decisions
- All team members use their laptops. When a blocker arise the members can search for the solution and debate it in the meanwhile

## When not to do it?

- Trivial tasks
- When the people who are doing PP are juniors
- if![When](#when?)

# Protecting the investment

## Volatility

Does the team have people junior?

Is it going to be a stable team?

Is it going to be a regular product?

## Formula

How probable is one team member to take a holiday?

How bad is that team member take a holiday?


## Iterative

If the team doesn't have experience working PP, you can start doing it iteratively.

## Business

Be aware that we are investing.
