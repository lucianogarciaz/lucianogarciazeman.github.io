# Investment

### Definition

**An investment means spending money now for a supposed future benefit.**

Three key variables:

- Profitability
- Risk
- Liquidity

↑ profitability ⇒ ↓ risk and liquidity

More profitability means more risk. More risk means uncertainty. It would be best if you never assign all your assess to something uncertain.

## Lack of investment vs technical debt

> The technical debt metaphor treats the cruft as a debt, whose interest payments are the extra effort these changes require

There are two ways of technical debt:

- Lack of investment
- Distribute the investment of a feature over time.

Note aside: **nothing justify shit code**.

### Distribute investment of a feature over time

Build a feature that may cause manual tasks, but it will be removed in the future. In the beginning, you can handle having manual tasks but will not scale in many of the processes.

### Lack of Investment

It's like a mortgage. You can get the money and start getting the benefits now and pay interest. Or save the money until you have collected all and start getting the benefits without paying interest.

Here you will always end having two ways of paying the debt:

- **Short term:** Delivery now and in the future will end developing the feature/product. In the meanwhile, you will have to pay interests.
- **Long term:** Invest in design/architecture, and then the new features will be easier to be developed.

You can't run away from debt. You will have to balance between the two options wisely.

# Profitability

Economic profitability measures **the rate of return of the investment** produced by a financial benefit concerning total capital.

# Return of Investment

Return of Investment is a way to measure profitability.

ROI = (Benefit - Investment) / investment

# Liquidity

Liquidity refers to the efficiency or ease with which an asset can be converted into ready cash without affecting its market price. The most liquid asset of all is cash itself.

In software, we should do small deliveries because it allows us to reassign in each delivery. Thus, focusing on what add more value

# Time to market

It is time it takes from when you start developing a product until it is on sale. If you are faster than your competition, you are more competitive and have more opportunities

# Risk

Financial risk is the probability of an adverse event happens and its consequences. The analysis of the risk in any investment is KEY
